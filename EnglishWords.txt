Justin: I need to talk to you about an offer I’ve been considering with another firm.
Ashley: You’re considering an offer to join another company? I thought you liked being apart of the team here. I am a little taken aback by this.
Justin: It wasn’t intentional by any means. They came and sought me out.
Ashley: Let me stop you right there. During your career you’re going to get a lot of offers to join other companies. You can’t go around entertaining every offer.
Justin: I understand. In this case, the offer I was given is going to take my career to the next level. My number one goal is to help my company become successful and with my current role I’m unable to do that.
Ashley: You may not realize this and I apologize for not saying it enough but your role is critical here.
Justin: If your goal is for me to be successful and help your business then I would like more responsibility and the opportunity to earn more money. What are my options?

You get the gist. Open the negotiation with your boss so that it is centred on how you can make their dept/division more successful and the only way that could happen is by giving your more responsibility.
Promotion means more responsibility. Ask for more responsibility versus a promotion. Everyone asks for a promotion. Then tie that responsibility into more compensation.
With more responsibility means more money. I have a good friend who just took on more responsibility with his job but didn’t ask for a raise.
It’s called Leverage. Memorize it. Think about it. The only way you change behaviour in a negotiation is through leverage.
Check first to see if you have leverage, competing job offer, and then use the leverage in your favour. No leverage means no raise or promotion.
Be prepared to have a mark on your back especially if you’re an average performer. Average performers don’t have leverage. Get leverage first then negotiate.


I am not a big spender, I don't live on the high life. Given all of these into considerations, what is the minimum amount of income I should expect?

Efficiency has primacy in conventional finance compared with ethics. 
Trade in stocks dealing with alcohol is not permissible in Islamic financial system. 
Islamic banks can charge interest on loans. 
All business decisions involving speculation are forbidden in Islamic finance. 
Financial institutions that act as facilitators are known as Urban banks.
Islamic ethics doesn't permit charging rent on money.
The Sharī‘ah伊斯兰法 permits lotteries in which no one has a personal right or stake.
The Sharī‘ah doesn't prohibit incentives to consumers when products are sold to them for a price. 

deferred sale or mark up sale. It's a sale transaction in which let's say the buyer will get the good and the buyer will pay on deferred payment basis. This
deferred payment will include a markup because of the time value. 
so in the conventional finance they talk about time value of money. It should be economic value of money, because money cannot generate a return only through time. It has to be coupled and integrated with real economic activity. 
Islamic finance strikes the balance. It doesn't eliminate finance altogether. It doesn't open the door for any kind of financing on the other hand. It allows for certain kind of financing, such that this financing is well related and linked with
economic activities. we have two kinds of debt, good debt and bad debt. So the question is where to draw the line? When to know that this is good debt? When to know that this is bad debt? So debt would be good if it is used to finance real economic activities. As long as debt creation and wealth creation are synchronized and going hand
in hand this will be...in principle at least...good debt. Once debt diverges from wealth creation, once it starts on it's own, once it starts self replicating then we know that we are in the dangerous zone.
The Islamic ethics has defined 10 core principles of an Islamic economic system. They are 1) property rights, 2) property obligations, 3) contracts, 4) trust, 5) individualize rights and obligations, 6) work, 7) wealth, 8) the concept of Barakah, 9) risk sharing, 10) competition and cooperation.

The first principle, Allah, the ultimate law giver, is the ultimate owner of all property existing in the world.
The second core principle concerns property obligations. 
The third core principle concerns contracts. Every contract must be Shari'ah compliant
The fourth core principle concerns trust. 
The fifth core principle concerns individual rights and obligations
The sixth core principle concerning work.
The seventh core principle concerns wealth.
The eighth core principle, an important one, concerns the concept of Barakah. 
The ninth core principle concerns risk sharing. The profit only comes with liability.
The tenth and last core principle concerns competition and cooperation. cooperation and competition are two sides of human nature. Humans can cooperate and compete amongst themselves for good or for evil. These attributes can lead to both integration or disintegration of this human society.

The efficiency of a financial system is measured based on how well the savings from Savings Surplus Units (SSUs) are allocated to Savings Deficit Units (SDUs) that need the funds. 
No product or service that an Islamic bank should offer should have any interest-bearing instruments.

Not sure if I missed it, but can you pls share what the root cause of the issue was, so that all the teams know what to avoid causing this issue again.
You don’t have to identify the project or the developer, although I don’t think we need to be so sensitive about this. The Teamcity build feedback often identifies exactly the file name and therefore the developer that caused errors. 
Having an obscure error such as this one is certainly not a statement on anyone’s skills or capabilities.
What would be more of a tragedy is if the error happens again someday because we didn’t share the learning from it this time round.

Dear colleagues,
In Global Banking and Markets, we have made 760 promotions across the business for 2017. Each of these represents an important individual milestone and demonstrates the strong opportunities for career development and progression within our business. 
To those who have been promoted, I would like to congratulate you and thank you for your hard work and positive contributions to delivering on our strategy. 

I would also like to take this opportunity to specifically call out those who have been promoted to Managing Director within Global Banking and Markets. I commend you on this significant career achievement. It is a recognition not only of your ability to contribute to the growth of the business, but also of your ability to lead, guide and inspire colleagues.  
 
Many thanks. All looks good.
Sorry for the delay. Should get a response from them soon, will keep an eye on this.

接下来打开浏览器:打开http://localhost:4444/wd/hub/static/resource/hub.html
1.创建session	2.打开百度	3.创建截图

如何验证你写的xptah/cssSelector是正确的呢？有以下几种方法：
•F12 ,使用浏览器的console  ，xpath使用$x()，css使用 $() 。如$("td>input[type='file']")，$x("//td/input[@type='file']”)

Ant，build.xml文件
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<project name="AntTest" default="run" basedir="." >
<!-- 默认target是run,运行ant命令直接执行run -->
    <echo message="The base dir is: ${basedir}" />
	
    <target name="clean">
       <delete dir="build"/>
    </target>
	
    <target name="compile" depends="clean">
    <!-- 编译java文件依赖clean -->
       <mkdir dir="build/classes"/>
        <javac srcdir="src" destdir="build/classes"/>
    </target>
    
    <target name="run" depends="compile">
    <!-- 运行class文件,依赖compile -->
     <echo message="Compile dir is:  ${basedir}\build\classes" />
      <java classname="Test">            
      <classpath>               
      <pathelement path="build/classes"/>            
      </classpath>        
      </java>
    </target>
</project>

What you need to pay attention:
1. <javac srcdir="src" destdir="build/classes" debug="on" encoding="UTF-8">
2. add jar file before clean target
<path id="run.classpath">
        <fileset dir="${basedir}">
            <include name="lib/testng.jar" />
            <include name="lib/sikuli-script.jar" />
        </fileset>
        <fileset dir="${basedir}/lib/selenium">
            <include name="selenium-java-2.45.0.jar" />
            <include name="libs/*.jar" />
        </fileset>
    </path>
    <taskdef name="testng" classname="org.testng.TestNGAntTask" classpathref="run.classpath" />
